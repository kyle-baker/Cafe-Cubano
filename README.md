# Caf√© Cubano
A simple application that allows users to search for buisnesses that serve Cuban Coffee. To start a search, the user must enter a valid U.S zip code. Once a zip code is entered the application will display a list of results in the area. The locations are retrieved via Foursquare's API and displayed in Google Maps.
