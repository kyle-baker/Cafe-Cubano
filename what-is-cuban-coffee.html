        <h2>What is Cuban Coffee?</h2>
        <p>Café Cubano (also known as Cuban espresso, Cuban coffee, cafecito, Cuban pull, Cuban shot) is a type of espresso that originated in Cuba. Specifically, it refers to an espresso shot which is sweetened with demerara sugar as it is being brewed, but the name covers other drinks that use Cuban espresso as their base. Drinking café cubano remains a prominent social and cultural activity in Cuba and Florida, especially in the regions surrounding Miami, Tampa and the Florida Keys.
